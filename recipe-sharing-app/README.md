# Recipe Haven 🍽️
Welcome to Recipe Haven, a web-based recipe management app built to help you create, store, and manage your favorite recipes right in your browser. This is a work in progress—feedback is welcome!




## 🌟 Features

- **Create and Save Recipes**: Add your favorite recipes with ingredients, instructions, and more.
- **Local Storage**: Recipes are stored in your browser’s localStorage for persistence.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience on all devices.
- **State Management**: Powered by Zustand for lightweight and efficient state handling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage

## 🚀 Getting Started
**Prerequisites**

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or Yarn

**Installation**

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-haven.git`
- `cd recipe-haven`


- Install dependencies: `npm install`


- Start the development server: `npm start` or `npm run dev`


- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

## 📖 Usage

- Navigate to the app and add a new recipe using the form.
- View, edit, or delete saved recipes.
- Recipes are stored in your browser’s localStorage, so they persist across sessions but are device-specific.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Designing a user-friendly and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.
- Managing localStorage for reliable data persistence and JSON handling.
- Learning and implementing Zustand for efficient state management across components.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Cross-Device Syncing**: Replace localStorage with a backend database (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB) for data syncing across devices.
- **User Authentication**: Add login functionality to save recipes per user.
- **Enhanced Features**: Include recipe search, categories, and image uploads.
